## Implementation (Week 2 - Week 9)

### Process

#### Sprinting & Crouching (Week 2)

<iframe width="560" height="315" src="https://blueprintue.com/render/3ppknt0b/" scrolling="no" allowfullscreen></iframe>

This Blueprint handles character movement mechanics, specifically sprinting and crouching, using the Enhanced Input system. The top section listens for the IA_Sprint input action, setting the Is Sprinting boolean accordingly. An Event Tick node continuously checks if the player is sprinting; if true, it sets the character’s Max Walk Speed to 500, otherwise, it defaults to 250. The bottom section listens for the IA_Crouching input action, toggling the Is Crouching boolean. A branch node determines whether the player should crouch or uncrouch, calling the corresponding Crouch or UnCrouch functions. These mechanics dynamically adjust the player's movement speed and stance based on input.

#### Checkpoint System (Week 2)

##### Collision with Checkpoint

<iframe width="560" height="315" src="https://blueprintue.com/render/0intg0xq/" scrolling="no" allowfullscreen></iframe>

This Blueprint handles a checkpoint system using an overlap event. When the player enters a trigger box, the OnComponentBeginOverlap event is triggered. It first retrieves the instigating actor and attempts to cast it to BP_ThirdPersonCharacter_C to ensure that the overlapping actor is the player character. If the cast is successful, it then retrieves the game instance by casting to BP_GameInstance_C. The script then saves the player's current world transform as the respawn location by using GetWorldTransform on a scene component, storing this data in the game instance. Finally, it sets a boolean variable Checkpoint On to true, indicating that the checkpoint has been activated. This setup ensures that when the player reaches a checkpoint, their position is saved for potential respawn or continuation.

##### Setting Respawn Position

<iframe width="560" height="315" src="https://blueprintue.com/render/a416ot_7/" scrolling="no" allowfullscreen></iframe>

This Blueprint handles the player's respawn system using the saved checkpoint data. The Event BeginPlay node is triggered when the game starts. It first retrieves the game instance by casting it to BP_GameInstance_C and checks if the Checkpoint On boolean is set to true. If a checkpoint was previously activated, the script retrieves the saved respawn transform (location, rotation, and scale) and applies it to the player using the SetActorTransform node, ensuring the player starts at the last checkpoint position. The script then enables player input by calling Enable Input and passing the player controller. Lastly, it sets the player's mesh visibility to ensure they are properly displayed after respawning. This system ensures that when the game begins, the player is repositioned at the last checkpoint if one exists.

#### Button Mashing QTE Mechanic (Week 3)

#### Flash Mechanic (Week 4)

##### Toggle Aiming Function

<iframe width="560" height="315" src="https://blueprintue.com/render/-4qrcf60/" scrolling="no" allowfullscreen></iframe>

This blueprint toggles a character's aiming mode by adjusting camera properties and visibility. When Toggle Aiming is triggered, it updates the Is Aiming Boolean and checks its value. If true, the camera's Field of View (FoV) is set to Aim FOV, the camera position shifts to aiming coordinates, and Is in Camera Mode is enabled. The character mesh is hidden, and the camera boom shortens to 0.0 for a closer view. If false, it resets the FoV to default, restores the camera position, disables Is in Camera Mode, makes the mesh visible, and extends the camera boom to 400.0, returning to third-person mode. This setup enables smooth transitions between third person and first person.

##### Trigger Flash Function

<iframe width="560" height="315" src="https://blueprintue.com/render/brecidsu/" scrolling="no" allowfullscreen></iframe>

This blueprint handles a flash effect by adjusting the intensity of a light component. The process starts with the Trigger Flash event, which activates the Set Intensity function. This function modifies the intensity of a spotlight attached to the BP Third Person Character, using a variable called New Intensity to determine the brightness level. The modified light intensity is applied to the spotlight component, creating the flash effect. After adjusting the light intensity, the Can Flash Boolean variable is set to control whether another flash can occur. This setup ensures that the light's intensity is dynamically changed when the event is triggered, allowing for a controlled flash effect.

##### Event Tick

<iframe width="560" height="315" src="https://blueprintue.com/render/zp5jj7pf/" scrolling="no" allowfullscreen></iframe>

This blueprint is executed every frame through the Event Tick node and is primarily responsible for smoothly updating the camera’s position, field of view, and light intensity. It first captures Delta Seconds to ensure smooth frame-dependent calculations. The Set Relative Transform node adjusts the position and rotation of a scene component, likely the camera or an attached object, interpolating values using FInterpTo for smooth transitions. The Field of View is also gradually adjusted based on aiming input, ensuring a dynamic zoom effect. Additionally, a spotlight’s intensity is modified over time, possibly to create a flashing or dimming effect, using interpolation to achieve a natural transition. A Branch node checks a condition before setting Can Flash which prevents continuous flashing. This blueprint effectively manages smooth camera movement, aiming mechanics, and light transitions for an immersive gameplay experience.

#### Dialogue QTE Mechanic (Week 5)
#### Gennerator Puzzle (Week 6)
#### Heartbeat QTE (Week 7)

#### Week 8 - 9

In the weeks of 8 & 9, I focused on implementing the mechanics I programmed into the game. This involved integrating various gameplay features to ensure the game functions as a cohesive and working game. My goal was to make sure all the mechanics operated smoothly and contributed to the overall player experience.

Alongside the implementation, I played a key role in polishing the game. This included refining the programming elements, fixing bugs, and improving the overall feel of the gameplay. Ensuring that the game was in its best possible state for submission was a priority, and I worked diligently to make sure everything was up to standard.

Additionally, I built the game to be played as an executable, which made it more accessible for testing and submission. This step allowed the team to easily share and test the game outside of the development environment, ensuring that the final product was ready for external review and ready for submission.

### Testing

Once we finished development, we moved on to the testing phase to ensure everything functioned as intended. We began by testing within the editor, carefully evaluating the mechanics and levels to identify any potential issues or inconsistencies. This allowed us to make necessary adjustments and refine the gameplay experience before proceeding further. After addressing any initial problems, we built the game and conducted another round of testing, this time focusing on how the mechanics and levels performed in the final build. This step was crucial for identifying any new issues that might have emerged due to the transition from the editor to the built version, ensuring a smoother and more polished experience for players.

### Technical Difficulties

One of my team members pushed their commits to their branch and then merged it with the main branch on GitHub, which caused conflicts between the log files in both branches. To resolve the issue, we removed the log files from their commits before pushing the changes to the main branch. After that, we added a line in the.gitignore file to ensure that GitHub would ignore log files in future commits, preventing similar conflicts from happening again.

## Critical Reflection (Week 10)

### Research Effectiveness

The research I conducted for this project has been incredibly valuable, providing me with a strong foundation for understanding the source material, *The Casting of Frank Stone*, and the broader context of horror and interactive narrative mechanics. Analyzing gameplay mechanics such as movement systems, QTEs, and flashlight mechanics helped me replicate the immersive experience of the original game, ensuring the gameplay elements in my project function cohesively to build tension. Exploring various horror mechanics like jump scares, task juggling, and hiding deepened my understanding of how to intensify emotional engagement, while research into interactive narrative mechanics, like choice and consequence and branching narratives, offered insight into crafting a responsive and dynamic story. Even though I didn’t play *The Casting of Frank Stone* directly, analyzing a full gameplay walkthrough provided critical understanding of its mechanics and concrete examples for my development. The sources that had the most significant impact were the gameplay analysis of *The Casting of Frank Stone*, the article on horror gameplay mechanics from *TheGamer*, and the insights from the *FasterCapital* article on interactive narrative mechanics. These sources collectively shaped my approach, from technical aspects like movement and QTEs to the narrative through concepts like branching storylines and dynamic character development. One key research gap that could have improved my outcomes is a deeper exploration of player psychology in horror games, particularly how different mechanics, such as pacing of scares or psychological tension, affect player engagement. I also could have benefited from more specific case studies on interactive narratives and research into horror game audio design, which would have helped refine the atmospheric elements of my game and improved its immersive experience.

### Positive Analysis

As a game developer, I actively contributed beyond my primary role by participating in the motion capture process, working closely with animator to ensure fluid and realistic character movements. Additionally, I took part in voice and SFX recording sessions, helping to capture high-quality audio assets that enriched the overall gaming experience. My involvement in these areas reflects my adaptability, commitment to teamwork, and passion for delivering immersive and polished game content. 

On the technical side, I successfully implemented the button-mashing mechanics, generator puzzle, and camera flash mechanic, ensuring smooth and highly responsive gameplay interactions. The button-mashing system was designed to provide an engaging challenge, requiring precise timing and player input, while the generator puzzle offered intuitive mechanics that balanced difficulty and engagement. The camera flash mechanic, a key feature for navigating dark environments, was fine-tuned to deliver instant visual feedback, allowing players to momentarily illuminate their surroundings and uncover hidden details.  These mechanics enhance immersion, responsiveness, and overall gameplay fluidity.

### Negative Analysis

I faced challenges while implementing both the dialogue QTE with multiple branches and the heartbeat QTE. To create multiple branches in the dialogue QTE, I modified the tick event to continuously loop through the dialogue array, breaking the struct and setting all the necessary variables. Within the Start QTE custom event, I used a switch statement to handle different dialogue options, assigning the output to a variable and updating the dialogue index accordingly. This ensured that the correct branching logic was applied, allowing the dialogue to flow properly based on the player's choices.

For the heartbeat QTE, I designed it similarly to a button-mashing QTE. In the tick event, I set a variable to track key presses and checked whether the input was within the allowed time. If the player pressed the key in time, the success count increased, displaying a success message; otherwise, the fail count increased, triggering a failure message. An outcome function then determined the next step: if the success count met the goal, the game transitioned to a dialogue QTE and deactivated the heartbeat QTE, while failing triggered a level sequence before deactivating the heartbeat QTE. To refine the system, I replaced the update function with a new trigger function that set a target press time, defined an input window, selected a random key for the player to press, and updated the UI. The key remained visible briefly, giving the player time to react. If they failed to press it, penalties were applied based on the outcome function.

### Next Time

I would approach the project as a C++ development endeavor, combining the power and efficiency of C++ with the flexibility of Blueprints. This hybrid approach would allow me to leverage the strengths of both programming paradigms, enabling the development of complex game mechanics and systems through C++, while also utilizing Blueprints for rapid iteration and visual scripting. By integrating both, I can ensure optimal performance where needed and maintain an accessible workflow for experimentation and prototyping. One improvement to my workflow is to upgrade to a larger storage solution than Git LFS for GitHub. This would allow me to manage and store larger assets more efficiently without running into storage limitations. Using a more robust storage system would ensure smooth collaboration and avoid potential disruptions during development. One improvement to my implementation process is to ensure that everything is organized within actor components. This approach would help modularize the code, making it easier to manage, extend, and debug. By using actor components consistently, I can achieve better reusability and maintain a more efficient workflow throughout the development process.
